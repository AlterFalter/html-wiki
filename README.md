# HtmlWiki

Easiest way of creating a wiki with HTML, JS and CSS. Doesn't need any server and runs also locally without any installs.

## Get started

Download the repository from Github.
Go into the folder and copy the code-folder to your documents folder.
Rename the copied code-folder to your liking.
Open the wiki.html file with a text editor (not word).
    On Windows you have "notepad" preinstalled.
    On Mac you have "TextEdit" preinstalled
    On Linux you know enough to decide it yourself 
        (but if not use nano (easier) or vim in the terminal depending on your level)
    Intermediate users will like the functionality of more advanced programs, such as Visual Studio Code, Notepad++ or Atom

### Create multiple pages

## External wiki files (intermediate level)

To have a better organized repository, you maybe want to split your wiki up in multiple files.
If you want to have every file to have it's own search field this is no problem.
Just copy and paste the wiki.html file as often as you need it.

If you want to split up the files but show everything on one web page, that's possible too
but it will require more time to setup on your side.
HTML would have an easy functionality for that but it is disabled by most browsers for security reasons.
We don't recommend disabling this and will not explain it here. 
If you know what your doing, it should be easy for you to find out how this works.

A better way is using a webserver. No worries, it's less than you think it is. 
Just install the programm [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html)

## External js files (intermediate level)

## Testing js functions (pro level)

## Q&A

Who is this repository for?
Mostly for students, that would like to have personalized wiki about the subject of their choice.

What should I expect?
In short: one-page-wiki
You get a single website to open locally (and offline) to create a wiki for whatever subject you like.
The wiki contains currently a single searchbox, which automatically goes through all the text displayed in the specified area.
The results are getting sorted when searched.
The whole application is designed to be easy and being run in a minute (literally).

What level of coding do I need?
Practically none, compare the turoial files with what you had in mind.
If you take the examples and change it to your text, your already good to go.
There is no magic you would need to understand.

I'm good at coding, can I still use it?
Yes, even better. You can get more out of it now. Just create bigger wikis with more advanced stuff now?

Should this rival Wikipedia or the wiki XYZ?
No! The search functionality goes by default only on the page itself and doesn't have a database connection to more articles.
Also you only can edit the files to edit the content, you can't edit the wiki with your browser.
A Wikipedia-like site is not possible, so we are not in competition with other wikis at all.

Why do you have a more advanced possiblities in a noob application?
Follow the steps and you don't need the intermediate level features. 
You don't need the other options, but they can make your life easier or better in the long run.

I want to make the code base better for this project. Will you accept my work?
Normally yes. When we decide the code has good enough quality, we happily accept your work.
Don't forget that it should be easy to use, also as a complete novice.

I can't code but still would like to contribute? OR I found a bug, what should I do? OR I would like a feature, what should I do?
